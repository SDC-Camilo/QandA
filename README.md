# QandA


Revamped monolithic legacy API to a microservice-oriented architecture capable of handling traffic at scale.

Expanded system throughput from 100 to 1,000 requests/second by horizontal scaling AWS EC2 instances using NGINX load balancers.

Ensured low latency (<5ms) and 0.00% error rate on every API endpoint.

Used K6 and Loader.io to identify and resolve system bottlenecks.
